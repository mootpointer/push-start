# Some wisdom...

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
I wanted to start today by sharing some wisdom that I've learned through my time working in startups and building new things inside bigger companies. It's something which is simultaneously terrifying and liberating.

---

## You are going to be wrong.

@snap[text-right fragment]

### (And that's okay)

@snapend

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
And it's that you're going to be wrong sometimes. Even with the best research and greatest strategies ‚Äì you're going to be wrong.

That's only half the wisdom. The kicker, and the thing that's probably harder to learn is that... that's okay. I'm talking later on today about psychological safety as a pre-requisite for innovation, but let's just put it this way for now: failure is inevitable and it's part of the process.

There's a trick to it, though. There's a trick to being wrong.

---

## Find out quickly when you are.

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
You need to find out quickly when you're wrong. You need to be able to course-correct, or return to the drawing board quickly. This is especially true in your early days when you don't have time or money to waste. I work for Microsoft, we've spent millions of dollars being wrong. That isn't great but we can survive that.

Startups I've worked for couldn't afford to waste even ten thousand dollars being wrong, so we had to find out quickly when we were wrong.

## Find out what works.

@snapend

@snap[east span-50 fragment]

## Throw out what doesn't.

@snapend

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
The early days of testing an idea are all about finding out what works. Seeing if the hunch I've got is correct.

Just as importantly as finding out what works is throwing out the things that don't. That doesn't mean they're thrown out forever, but they shouldn't be what you continue to invest in or what you're focusing on right now.

# Beware sunk cost fallacy.

@snap[fragment text-right]
<span style="font-size: 32px">Invest as little as you can into finding out if you are wrong.</span>
@snapend

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
What happens when we over-invest and then find out we're wrong is that we keep going anyway because we've invested so much that it feels like we have to get something from our investment. If you find out you're wrong early, and actually throw it away or put it aside, you're less likely to get caught up in this.

So the strategy is this: invest as little as you can into finding out if you're wrong.

# An example...

@snap[text-right fragment]
@quote[Build a new service for directly coaching users.]
@snapend

Note:
Let's make this real with an example. This actually happened to me in a previous role. In a three year old startup, where I was responsible for technical strategy and delivery. I had a small-ish team and we were already feeling pretty under the pump moving things forward.

We had an opportunity to create a new business line by making a coaching services for users. The problem was this business line was effectively a new product, connecting users with humans which we didn't have in our app at the moment. So I looked at what it would cost us to build this new functionality.

---

# The cost...

@ul

- Workflow and user selection (üí∏)
- Messaging service (üí∞)
- Build feature into iPhone & Android apps (ü§ë)

@ulend

Note:
So I looked at what we'd have to build:

- A workflow engine and a way to select users for coaching.
- A way to message users which made sense inside an existing app.
- and a way to deliver content into both iPhone and Android apps.

This was weeks on weeks of developer time and thus tens of thousands of dollars, not to mention opportunity cost of not working on things that we _knew_ were important.

@size[32px](Invest as little as you can into finding out if you are wrong.)

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
Remember what I said before? Invest as little as you can into finding out if you're wrong. If we'd taken this route, we were going to have to invest a lot of time and money into finding out if this line of business was even viable. Would users respond to the coaching? Was the content right? Would our customers actually pay for it?

So we decided to do a test instead to try and find out if we were wrong, as cheaply as possible.

---

# The test:

@ul

- Google Form (Free)
- SMS/Phone service (\$60/mo)
- Zapier (Free tier)
- Wix Website
  @ulend

@snap[south-east text-right]
<span style="font-size: 20px">Andrew Harvey | @mootpointer</span>
@snapend

Note:
We decided to distill down what we wanted to test ‚Äì that we could provide a coaching service, people would use it, and it would satisfy our customers ‚Äì and work out the least time and money commitment we could make while still validly testing it.

This presentation is about tools, so let me tell you about the tools we used:

- A google form
- An SMS/Phone service so that we could contact and coach users without revealing our personal phone numbers
- Zapier ‚Äì an integration service to glue together some of the pieces
- and a Wix website to present the content on

We didn't use any of our developers' time. They got to stay focused on the existing product.
